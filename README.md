Introduction to R for Bioinformatics
======================================

The goals of this lesson are 1) to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis, and 2) to teach novice programmers how to modify scripts to accomodate their own data. 

R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages. The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this course will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the programming language R and will not teach statistical or bioinformatic analysis. A variety of third party packages will be used, chosen primarily for their usability and not necessarily because they are the best or most comprehensive.

These lesson materials are adapted from the [R-novice-gapminder](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) materials and the [DESeq2 manual](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.pdf).

Learning objectives:

* To gain familiarity working in the RStudio enviornment
* To understand variables and how to assign to them
* To be able to use mathematical and comparison operations
* To be able to call functions
* To work with R libraries and modify scripts to accomodate your data
